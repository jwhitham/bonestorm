# Bone Storm!

Select matching tiles as quickly as you can!

Bone Storm shows a grid of dog pictures. To complete each level,
pick one of the dogs and touch each of the tiles that match,
marking them with a bone. Tiles that aren't marked will update, showing
a different dog. When all tiles are marked and all show the same dog, the level is complete.

Updates always follow the same sequence. Complete levels as quickly as you
can by learning the sequence and picking the tiles in the best order.
